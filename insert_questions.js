A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity‚Äîbut that would be asking too much of fate! Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it. Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?',
