# Fix for Admin Panel Question Loading Issues

## Problem
The admin panel shows "please login again" messages when trying to view questions in the manage exams section, even though users are properly logged in. This is caused by conflicting Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the questions table.

## Solution

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open and run the file: `FINAL_QUESTIONS_RLS_FIX.sql` (located in your project root)
4. This script will:
   - Remove all conflicting RLS policies
   - Set up proper permissions for admin users
   - Allow authenticated users to read questions

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
1. After running the SQL script, refresh your admin panel
2. Questions should now load properly in the manage exams section
3. You can test the fix by clicking "ðŸ”§ Fix RLS Issue" button in the debug tools section

### Step 3: Test Function (Optional)
You can verify the fix worked by running this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT * FROM verify_questions_access();
```

This should return:
- `success = true`
- A count of questions > 0
- Your user role should show as "admin"

## What was Fixed
- **Authentication Loop**: Improved session handling with retry logic
- **RLS Conflicts**: Removed conflicting policies and created clear, single policies
- **Error Messages**: Better error handling that guides users to the fix
- **Debugging Tools**: Added helpful debug buttons in the admin panel

## Files Modified
- `apps/web/app/admin/exams/page.tsx` - Better error handling and retry logic
- `FINAL_QUESTIONS_RLS_FIX.sql` - Comprehensive database policy fix

## Future Prevention
The fix ensures that:
1. Only authenticated users can read questions (which is what students and admins need)
2. Only admin users can modify/create/delete questions
3. Session refreshing is automatic when possible
4. Clear error messages guide users to solutions

If you encounter similar issues in the future, check for multiple conflicting RLS policies on your database tables.
