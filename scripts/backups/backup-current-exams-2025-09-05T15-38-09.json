Text 2 is a work of literary criticism about Middlemarch. \n\nText 1: \n[Caleb Garth] took the paper and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached his pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again, then pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness __(pardon these details for once — you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb Garth).__ \n\nText 2: \nIn addition to providing detailed accounts of characters' mannerisms, Middlemarch's narrator reveals characters' innermost thoughts with great specificity. As a result, the omniscient narrator is frequently conflated with the author herself (George Eliot). Occasionally, though, in direct addresses to the reader, the narrator is represented as reminiscing about characters as if they were personal acquaintances. Foregrounding the narrator's own fictionality, such gestures counteract the tendency to identify the narrator with the author, a tendency of which Eliot was wary. \n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined portion in Text 1?",

The team used three separate extraction methods: an ultrapur water rinse, a rinse combined with ultrasonic waves, and an alkaline solution treatment that removes epicuticular wax (a surface coating) on most land plants to which particulates can adhere). The concentrations of particulates recovered were 7.6 percent for water extraction, 38.4 percent for ultrasonic extraction, and 53.8 percent for alkaline extraction, leading the team to conclude that previous assessments have likely underestimated forest canopies' capacity as sinks.\\n\\nWhich detail, if true, would most directly support the team's conclusion?",

Effects of this thermoregulation were not limited to the fungi's fruiting bodies and root-like hyphae; __temperature reductions were observed in the air immediately surrounding the mushrooms__. Though slight, the reductions inspired an air-cooling device; using approximately 400 grams of mushrooms, the team's prototype lowered the air temperature in a controlled environment by 10°C in forty minutes.\\n\\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",

To answer this question, Alicia Grasby et al. identified 30 extended-brand pairs (e.g., the same brand of shoes and gloves) in 52 weeks of purchases by approximately 60,000 households and, for each pair, calculated the change in probability of a brand in one category being purchased if the same brand was purchased in the other category.\\n\\nBased on the text, which potential study design would be most likely to produce evidence that would enable Grasby et al. to answer their research question?",

Many countries define urban settlements based on the number of people living in them. However, countries do not all use the same number; for example, Iceland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a combination of population and other factors. This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.\\n\\n**Text 2**\\nRecently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements. The group developed a new measure called the \"degree of urbanization.\" This new measure establishes global criteria used to define three types of settlements (cities, towns, and rural areas) and allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates.\\n\\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the problem presented in Text 1?",

The narrator describes practicing the piano when she was a child.\n\nFor the talent show, I was to play a piece called \"Pleading Child\" from Schumann's Scenes from Childhood. It was a simple, moody piece that sounded more difficult than it was. I was supposed to memorize the whole thing, playing the repeat parts twice ot make the piece sound longer. But I dawdled over it, playing a few bars and then cheating, looking up to see what notes followed. I never really listened ot what I was playing. I daydreamed about being somewhere else, about being someone else.\n\nBased on the text, when the narrator describes herself as \"cheating,\" what does she most likely mean?",
