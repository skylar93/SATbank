Text 2: 
In addition to providing detailed accounts of characters' mannerisms, Middlemarch's narrator reveals characters' innermost thoughts with great specificity. As a result, the omniscient narrator is frequently conflated with the author herself (George Eliot). Occasionally, though, in direct addresses to the reader, the narrator is represented as reminiscing about characters as if they were personal acquaintances. Foregrounding the narrator's own fictionality, such gestures counteract the tendency to identify the narrator with the author, a tendency of which Eliot was wary.

Daruis, a teenager from the United States, is visiting his grandparents, Mamou and Babou, and other family members in Iran.I was too tired to fall all the way asleep, and even though Mamou was soft and warm, leaning up against her wasn’t a terribly comfortable position to sleep in. So I dozed and floated on the clouds of Farsi that blew my way from the front seat of Dayi [Uncle] Jamsheed’s SUV.It reminded me of when I was little, and Mom chanted to me in Farsi every night before bedtime. It’s hard to describe Farsi chanting: the way Mom drew her voice out like the notes of a cello as she recited poems by Rumi or Hafez. I didn’t know what they meant, but that didn’t matter. It was quiet and soothing.

This structure, which the team named Nadir, exhibits all the telltale signs of a high-velocity impact crater: an elevated rim, a circular shape, a terraced floor, and a pronounced area of uplift at its center.Text 2Both carbonate dissolution and subsurface salt withdrawal can cause craterlike depressions without the need for a high-velocity impact. However, carbonate dissolution is very unlikely to have occurred in the vicinity of Nadir, and although subsurface salt withdrawal could have plausibly occurred in this area and would result in a depression with a terraced floor or a circular shape, it would not exhibit the area of central uplift seen at Nadir.

- Kepler's first law of planetary motion states that the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse. 
- The law also states that, in an elliptical orbit, the object being orbited is one of the ellipse's foci. 
- Kepler's laws of planetary motion also apply to natural satellites (e.g., moons). 
- Mimas is a moon of Saturn that orbits the planet in 0.94 Earth days on average. 
- Mimas's orbit is elliptical.

The student wants to provide an explanation and example of Kepler's first law of planetary motion.

Ever since fossilized remains of this species were discovered in 1895, scientists have been perplexed by its size. After examining 154 ammonite fossils including some of P. seppenradensis from Montana and Parapuzosia leptophylla (a smaller ammonite species) from England, paleontologist Christina Ifrim, Andrew S.
