We [people] are creatures of the sun. We love light and life. That is why we crowd into the towns and cities, and the country grows more and more deserted every year. In the sunlight --- in the daytime, when Nature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and the deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has gone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and we get frightened, like children in a silent house. Then we sit and sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the answering throb of human life.

Because these effects are incremental and can generally be repaired (though at some cost), structures in northern and western Nebraska are typically not built to resist them.Text 2In a 2021 study, Rubayet Bin Mostafiz and colleagues calculated that in the state of Louisiana alone, the annual cost of damage caused by expansive soils reaches nearly $90 million. But they note that this damage can be mitigated: building structures on pile supports can significantly reduce the effects of soil swelling and shrinking.

Based on the texts, how would Rubayet Bin Mostafiz and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the information presented in Text 1?","{""A"":""They would recommend that engineers in northern and western Nebraska measure the moisture level in the soil beneath proposed structures before beginning construction."",""B"":""They would argue that engineers in northern and western Nebraska have misjudged the effectiveness of the techniques they use to reduce the effects of expansive soil."",""C"":""They would encourage engineers in northern and western Nebraska to use pile supports when building new structures."",""D"":""They would suggest that engineers in northern and western Nebraska consider the cost of replacing the pile supports on which existing structures rest.""}","","pending",""

The researchers recorded Yupno speakers explaining certain temporal words and phrases, such as abjuk sonda, a present-oriented expression that translates to “this week,” and coded each speaker's manual gestures. Previous research has found a tendency in many cultures to make temporal distinctions using spatial concepts and gestures, particularly along egocentric axes (i.e., relative to the orientation of the speaker): for instance, Spanish speakers often refer to the left/right axis to describe events in time. In an anthropology paper, a student claims that the tendency toward ego-based conceptualizations of time is universal.

Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the student's claim?","{""A"":""A Yupno speaker points in opposite directions when indicating a past event versus a future event."",""B"":""Some Yupno grammatical structures used when talking about time are also used in Spanish."",""C"":""When Yupno speakers who are outdoors use gestures to refer to the future, they point uphill from their current location regardless of which way they are facing."",""D"":""Although Yupno speakers and Spanish speakers both use gestures to indicate orientation in time, Yupno speakers tend to use fewer gestures overall when speaking than Spanish speakers do.""}","","pending",""

Ocher is a mineral-based pigment used to make several colors, including red. Red ocher gets its color from iron oxide. Pigments can also be plant-based; plant-based pigments contain a high level of carbon. In a 2023 study, archaeologists tested the red pigment on decorated beads made by members of the Natufian culture approximately 15,000 years ago. The test showed that the pigment found on several beads contained no iron but had a high level of carbon. This finding led the researchers to conclude that <span class=""fill-blank"" style=""display: inline-block; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; width: 90px; height: 1.2em;""></span>.  </p><br><p>Which choice most logically completes the text?</p>","{""A"":""the Natufian beadmakers used plant-based pigments rather than ocher to decorate some of the beads examined in the study."",""B"":""the pigments used by the Natufian beadmakers likely came from plants because ocher was difficult to find."",""C"":""the Natufian beadmakers preferred to use plant-based pigments because they are much brighter than mineral-based pigments are."",""D"":""the Natufan beads examined in the study are the oldest surviving examples of the use of plant-based pigments for decorating beads.""}","","converted",""

Berndt and Travis K. Bavin found a positive association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury in bodies of fresh water. Many other studies have yielded similar results, suggesting to some scientists that this association is true for all bodies of fresh water. But much of that research has been conducted at broadly similar sites in North America, and when Seam Noh and colleagues examined bodies of fresh water in South Korea, they found a negative association between dissolved organic carbon levels and mercury levels.
