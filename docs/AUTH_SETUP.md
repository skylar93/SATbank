# Authentication System Setup Guide

## ✅ Phase 3 Complete: Authentication System

### Features Implemented

1. **Auth Context Provider** (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
   - User state management
   - Sign in/up/out functions
   - Role-based permissions (admin/student)

2. **Protected Routes Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
   - Automatic redirects based on auth status
   - Role-based route protection
   - Public route handling

3. **Authentication Pages**
   - Login page (`/login`) - Email/password authentication
   - Signup page (`/signup`) - New user registration with profile setup
   - Home page with smart redirects

4. **Role-Based Dashboards**
   - Student dashboard (`/student/dashboard`) - Personal progress and exam access
   - Admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) - System management and analytics

5. **Navigation Component**
   - Role-based menu items
   - User profile display
   - Sign out functionality

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enforced at database level
- **Route protection** via Next.js middleware
- **Role-based access control** (students can only see their data)
- **Automatic session management** with Supabase Auth

### How to Test

1. **Create an Admin User:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor after a user signs up
   UPDATE user_profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
   ```

2. **Test Student Flow:**
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Create account (automatically gets 'student' role)
   - Gets redirected to `/student/dashboard`

3. **Test Admin Flow:**
   - Sign up normally, then update role in database
   - Sign in - gets redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

4. **Test Route Protection:**
   - Try accessing `/student/dashboard` as admin → redirects to admin dashboard
   - Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` as student → redirects to student dashboard
   - Try accessing protected routes without auth → redirects to login
