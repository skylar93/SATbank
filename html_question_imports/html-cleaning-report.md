## Question 3 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
The Gleaners, painted in the realist style by Jean-Francois Millet, depicts peasants picking stray wheat from a field after the harvest. The realists’ emphasis on accurately portraying the experiences of average working people was largely a rejection of the romantic style evident in many paintings by Jérôme-Martin Langlois, which instead ______ their subjects’ beauty or heroism while hiding all imperfection.

## Question 5 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
In what is now Washington state, the Tulalip Tribes operate the Hibulb Cultural Center. Relying on traditional knowledge to guide the design of exhibits, this institution presents Tulalip history and culture to the tribe’s citizens. The Citizen Potawatomi Nation, a tribe in Oklahoma, employs a similar strategy in its own cultural center. Both centers contrast with museums that aren’t Indigenous-led; when displaying Indigenous artifacts, such museums tend to anticipate mainly non-Indigenous audiences and rely on Euro-centric strategies for designing exhibits.

Which best describes the overall structure of the text?

## Question 6 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
Luang Prabang has high pedestrian traffic, but simply replicating a feature of Luang Prabang associated with walkability—e.g., its human-scaled architecture—may be insufficient to induce increased walking in other cities. As urbanist Mariela Alfonzo argues, our understanding of individuals’ decision-making about whether to walk is insufficiently robust: some studies emphasize the role of local norms, others the role of demographic characteristics, and so on, but walking decisions are made in complex context in which multiple conditions and needs inform individuals’ choices.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

## Question 7 📷

## Question 8 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
Researcher César A. Hidalgo, Elisa Castaner, and Andres Sevtsuk created a computer model to predict the mix of businesses and places of interest found in a given neighborhood. The team used data from the Google Places API service to help identify furniture stores, florists, and other businesses and map their locations. This approach has some limits—data from Places API tend to be restricted to places that are customer facing—but the data set nonetheless provides an extremely reliable source to study colocation patterns of neighborhood amenities.

According to the text, what is one potential drawback of Hidalgo and colleagues’ method?

## Question 12 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
To understand the extent of deforestation in the Chorotega Region of Costa Rica, Juan Pablo Arroyo-Mora and colleagues used aerial photography and remote sensing data to track changes in the forest cover area across different land use capability class (categories that indicate possible uses of forest land.) Due to the Chorotega region’s accessibility, various types of forest areas were converted to cattle practices as rising international meat prices drove a cattle ranching boom in the 1960s and 1970s. By the mid 1980s, however, increased public awareness and environmental reforms, along with a decline in meat prices, engendered a natural forest regrowth, as evident by the ______

## Question 13 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
Veronica L. Bura, Akito Y. Kawahara, and Jayne E. Yack investigated the evolution and function of sound production in silk moth and hawk moth caterpillars. They found that during harmless simulated attacks on isolated caterpillars, 33% of the tested species produced sound, which ranged from clicks in Manduca pellenia to whistles in Rhodinia fugax. Although some insects use sound to communicate with members of the same species, the researchers claim that the caterpillar sounds recorded in their study are directed primarily at predators.

- B) Chickens and yellow warblers, two predators of caterpillars, have been observed to stop their attacks in response to caterpillar sounds.
- C) Caterpillar clicks were emitted in a frequency detectable by birds that prey on caterpillars, but caterpillar whistles were not.
- D) Each caterpillar species tended to produce one sound during simulated attacks, although individuals occasionally made a variety of other sound during simulated attacks as well.

**Correct Answer:** Chickens and yellow warblers, two predators of caterpillars, have been observed to stop their attacks in response to caterpillar sounds.

## Question 14 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
The British Bronze Age began when sophisticated techniques for making tools, weapons, and other objects from metal were introduced to the British Isles around 2500 BCE, and it lasted until around 700 BCE. In Britain during this time, collections of valuable metal objects (called hoards) were sometimes buried for safekeeping. Some stayed buried for many centuries, such as the Parc-y-Meirch hoard, which was unearthed around 1868, and the Fittleworth hoard, discovered in 1995. And although the period is known as the Bronze Age, some hoards, like the Fittleworth hoard, contained decorative objects made of gold; gold was much rarer than bronze, however, and thus it is not surprising that ______

## Question 15 📷

**Original Plain Text:**
The state of North Dakota has designated the spiny water flea as an invasive species that could outcompete some of the state’s native species. Many other states draw similar distinctions between invasive and native species. But researchers Alejandro Camacho and Jason McLachlan have pointed out that Earth’s climate is changing in ways that challenge such designations. Climate changes may cause animals to leave their current ranges and establish new ones. Climate changes may also create good habitats in areas where a species couldn’t live previously. These observations suggest that ______
